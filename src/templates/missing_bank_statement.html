<p>Hi {{customer_name}},</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting ParkM regarding your refund request. We're reviewing your account now.</p>

<p>To process your refund, our accounting team requires a bank statement or credit card statement showing the charge(s) from ParkM. This helps us verify the transaction and ensure the refund is applied to the correct account.</p>

<p>Please reply with a screenshot or PDF of your statement showing the ParkM charge. You may redact any sensitive information — we only need to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date of the charge</li>
  <li>The charge amount</li>
  <li>The merchant name (ParkM)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once received, we'll submit your refund right away.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br>
ParkM Support Team</p>
