<p>Hi {{customer_name}},</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting ParkM about your payment. We're looking into this and want to make sure everything is resolved for you.</p>

<p>To help us investigate, could you please confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date and amount of the charge in question</li>
  <li>Your license plate number (so we can locate your account)</li>
  <li>Whether you're seeing a duplicate charge, unexpected charge, or a failed payment</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we have those details, we'll review your account and follow up right away.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br>
ParkM Support Team</p>
