<p>Hi {{customer_name}},</p>

<p>Thank you for reaching out to ParkM. We've carefully reviewed your refund request and want to share our findings.</p>

<p>Based on your account information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move-out date: {{move_out_date}}</li>
  <li>Last charge date: {{last_charge_date}}</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, your move-out date falls outside our 30-day refund window from the date of your last charge. Per our terms and conditions, refunds are available when a move-out occurs within 30 days of the most recent billing date.</p>

<p>We understand this may be disappointing, and we're sorry we're unable to process a refund in this case.</p>

<p>If you believe there has been an error, or if you have additional documentation that changes these dates, please reply and we'll be happy to take another look.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding,<br>
ParkM Support Team</p>
