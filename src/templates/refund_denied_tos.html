<p>Hi {{customer_name}},</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting ParkM. We've reviewed your request and unfortunately are unable to issue a refund at this time.</p>

<p>Per our <a href="https://parkm.app/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>, parking permit charges are non-refundable except in the case of a qualifying move-out within 30 days of the last billing date.</p>

<p>We understand this isn't the answer you were hoping for. If you feel your situation qualifies for an exception, or if you have any additional context you'd like us to consider, please reply and we'll escalate your request for further review.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding,<br>
ParkM Support Team</p>
